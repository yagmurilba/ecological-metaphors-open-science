    "- Avoid very long phrases (keep concept labels under 6-7 words).\n",

      "Barth et al. (2006) have explored the operationalization of CI in software systems through the use of ﬁrst-order temporal logic to express information ﬂows and their appropriateness. They demonstrate how CI can be translated into a formal logic that can be used to reason about the appropriateness of information ﬂows in software systems. This work highlights the potential for technical systems to embody and enforce privacy norms based on CI principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of privacy-preserving technologies, differential privacy (Dwork 2006) has emerged as a powerful tool to protect individual privacy while allowing for useful data analysis. Differential privacy provides a mathematical guarantee that the presence or absence of any individual’s data in a dataset will not impact the outcome of the analysis. This approach aligns with the principles of privacy as a commons, where the protection of individual privacy contributes to the collective good of preserving privacy norms within a community.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the literature on engaging with underlying technical processes to build privacy-preserving capacities emphasizes the importance of embedding privacy protections at the design stage of software systems. By incorporating privacy principles such as CI and differential privacy into technical architectures, it is possible to create systems that respect and enforce privacy norms within a community.\n",

      "In this demonstration, we have presented a Protégé plug-in designed to facilitate the annotation of OWL ontologies with OPLa annotations. By providing a user-friendly interface and guiding the user through the annotation process, the plug-in aims to streamline the documentation of ontology design patterns and promote their reuse and sharing within the ontology engineering community. The tool is available for download and further exploration, and we welcome feedback and suggestions for improvement.\n",

These inequalities are also reflected in the research evaluation systems, where certain criteria and standards may disadvantage researchers from underrepresented groups or regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this context, it is crucial to rethink research assessment in a way that promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion in the scientific community. This includes reevaluating the criteria used for evaluation, ensuring that different forms of research output are valued, and creating opportunities for researchers from diverse backgrounds to contribute and be recognized for their work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the shift towards open science requires a reevaluation of the role of metrics and indicators in research assessment. While traditional metrics like journal impact factors have been widely used, they may not capture the full impact and value of research, especially in the context of open science where data sharing, collaboration, and transparency are key components.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the evolution of research assessment towards open science in a diverse world necessitates a holistic approach that considers the multiple dimensions of research impact, values diversity and inclusion, and adapts to the changing landscape of scholarly communication. By rethinking research evaluation practices, we can create a more equitable and inclusive research ecosystem that benefits all researchers and society as a whole. \n",
